This .txt file is in the restaurant folder with the following structure:

restaurant
|   src
    |   front_of_house
        |   hosting.rs
    
    |   front_of_house.rs

    |   bin.rs

    |   lib.rs

|   target
    |   [...]

|   Cargo.toml

|   Cargo.lock

The restaurant directory was created on the command line by entering:
    "cargo new restaurant"
which automatically created a package called restaurant, and which held
the src/ and target/ folders, and the Cargo.* files.

A package is an entire project typcially, and contains one or more crates
which are groups of functionality. There are two types of crate:

    - Binary crates contain a binary file that can be executed. This file
    must have a "main" function and is often called "main.rs" or "bin.rs"

    - Library crates cannot be executed and exist to group functionality 
    together and have it be used by binary crates.

When a binary crate is created (like above) it is automatically given a 
"main.rs" file in the src/ folder, and cargo assumes this to be the root 
of the binary crate. To change this, Cargo.toml must be updated as follows:

    [[bin]]
    name = "bin_name_enter_here"
    path = "path to bin crate root, probably src/bin.rs or something"

When a library crate is created (like above but with a --lib after the new
keyword) it is automatically given a "lib.rs" file in the src/ folder, and
cargo assumes this to be the root of the library crate.

If a package has a bin crate and a lib crate that it needs to 
use, it must have that lib crate specified in Cargo.toml as follows:

    [lib]
    name = "lib_name_enter_here"
    path = "path to lib crate root, probably src/lib.rs or something"

According to the Cargo.toml file, they are simply called "bin" and "lib"
and there roots are "src/bin.rs" and "src/lib.rs", respectively.

The lib crate contains also front_of_house.rs, and the contents of the 
"src/front_of_house/" folder.

The bin crate is able to access this functionality because of two things:
    - The lib crate is declared as a library in the Cargo.toml file
    - It has a "use" statement where it brings the library into scope.
